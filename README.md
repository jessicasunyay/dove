# dove

hello and welcome to dove!
what started from a hackathon submission is now a full project that we plan to implement and offer to students everywhere.
dove includes:
      - a chrome extension with a communication feature to notify teachers that you are having a mental health emergency
      - a database that allows students to create an account, add their schedule for automatic notifications, and keep track of their uses
      - a website with more resources to educate and support students' mental health
      
thank you!
